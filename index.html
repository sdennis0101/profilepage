                <p>17. Totally obsessed about all things space. If you asked me, i can tell you all about habitable moons that saturn has and how beautiful a saturn rise is. I also can calculate approxiamtely how much cubic feet of space and how many materials we would need in order to create a functioning and orbiting spcae habitat that could none tne less replace Earth as a whole. Btw uf we did we would live in the kuniper belt </p>
                <p>We could also create these things called self creating and functioning machines in the kuniper belt that will essentially create more space habitats to best accomodate own expansive population </p>
